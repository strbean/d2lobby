-------------------

A simple site to track Diablo 2 (Resurrected) lobby names for repeated runs. When running the same content repeatedly,
players will typically use the same lobby name with an incrementing number at the end. For example:

- ChaosWaffles1
- ChaosWaffles2
- ChaosWaffles3

Keeping track of the numbers can be a pain, so d2lobby makes it a bit easier.
